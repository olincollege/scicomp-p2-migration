Scientific Computing Project 2: Volatile Migration and Loss of Water and Carbon Dioxide on Mercury

This project is intended to detail the proporiton of molecules lost to process such as photoionization, photodissociation, and thermal escape. Due to Mercury being close to the sun, many molecules do not reach stability. This project is intended to investigate the main causes of loss and the significance of each process.

## Dependencies and Repository Overview
To run the software, you will need the following libaries:
* matplotlib
* plotly
* mayavi
* numpy
* ipykernel

All of the libraries are included in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed by entering the following into terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The repository and project is currently being updated. Check the branch `PDF` to see the most recent changes.
